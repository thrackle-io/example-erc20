# Documentation maintenance

This repository has two types of documentation:
1. Manually generated - this is the documentation that is written by hand
2. Auto-generated - this is the documentation that is generated by the code

## Manually Generated Documentation
The manually generated documentation root can be found [here][userGuide-url].

## Auto-generated Documentation
This repository utilized Foundry documentation generation for files using NatSpec comments. The commands to generate this documentation and to keep them up to date are:
(Note: This is currently performed by CI/CD processes and not manually run.)
The root of the documentation can be found [here](./src/SUMMARY.md).
```
foundryup --version $(awk '$1~/^[^#]/' foundry.lock)
forge doc

# Wave Token 
- [Wave Token](./UserGuides/wave/WAVE.md) is an ERC20 Upgradeable token and allows for the logic contract to be updated overtime. Wave token will utilize existing rules protocol architecure: the asset handler, application manager and handler, and the rule processor diamond. Wave token uses Access Control Upgradeable for the admin roles that guard certain functions within the token.
