# User Guide

[![Project Version][version-image]][version-url]

## Introduction

This guide is intended to be a user-friendly introduction to [Wave token](./wave/README.md). It provides a walkthrough of how to get started with the token.

## Installation and Tooling

##### This is designed to be tested and deployed with Foundry. Install Python 3.11, Homebrew, and then install [foundry using Thrackle's `foundryup`](https://github.com/thrackle-io/foundry). This applies numbered versions to upstream Foundry releases.

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
brew install jq
```

```
mkdir -p ~/.foundry/bin/
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thrackle-io/foundry/refs/heads/master/foundryup/foundryup -o ~/.foundry/bin/foundryup
chmod +x ~/.foundry/bin/foundryup
~/.foundry/bin/foundryup --version $(awk '$1~/^[^#]/' foundry.lock)
```

_Note: `awk` in the above command is used to ignore comments in `foundry.lock`_


Now that you have the dependencies installed, you are ready to build the project. Do:

`forge build` in the project directory to install the submodules and create the artifacts.

And you are done!
